# Welcome!

You are signed up for a course that requires basic programming skills in Python. The challenges presented in this precourse-test are designed to give you insight into your current Python skills. 

The challenges presented in these [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org) that will be running on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Please note that you will need a Google account to actually run the notebooks. 

Your answers and progress will not be known to the teacher: they have no access to your progress on these challenges. So, it is up to you to solve the challenges yourself and to be honest to yourself. At the end of these challenge, some well meant advice will be given. It is up to you to follow this up.

## The Structure Of The Challenges
Each of the notebook file contains a challenge, which is auto-graded. For each challenge, you should start by reading the instructions in the first cell. In the second cell, you are requested to code your solution by replacing these two lines:
```python
# YOUR CODE HERE
raise NotImplementedError()
```
with your own Python code. As long as you do not change these lines, your function will raise a `NotImplementedError` error when run.

The third cell can be used to enter the requested values and test your function. The fourth cell will test your solution against a number of test cases. If you solved the challenge correctly, you will see a message like:
```
Well done! You seem to have solved challenge_1!
```

## Debugging
Even in relatively small Python programs, you will discover that it is easy to make mistakes. To find out what the problem is, programmers often add `print()` statements at strategic places throughout their code, so that they can confirm whether their program actually reaches that location, and can inspect the current values of some variables there.

Example:
```python
def my_function(a, b):
    print('value of a is', a)
    ...
```

Please use them often. The **prints** will not influence the auto-grading mechanism, since these only check the finally returned value from your function.

## Final instruction

Before you start solving any of the challenge, please press `Ctrl-Enter` in very first the cell (PC) or `Command-Enter` (Mac). It will load the modules needed for testing and auto-grading the challenges. After you did, a number between the square brackets will appear in front of the cell, like - for example:
```python
[1]
```
If successful, the following message will appear below the first cell:
```python
Assertions imported OK
Test cells imported OK
```

## First challenge

Once you have read the instructions above, you are ready to continue to the first challenge:
